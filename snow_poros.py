def snow_porosimetry(snow,porosimetry,binary_image):
    """ 
    This funtion segmentates the porous space according to the SNOWPOROS algorithm. The aim is to reduce the oversegmentation of enlongated elliptical pores caused by marker-based watershed segmentation algorithms.
    The map obtained from the porosimetry map (or local thickness) is used to filter the markers obtained from the SNOW algortihm.Hence, only the peaks that appear inside
    the largest circles or spheres (compared to the circles that sourrounds the aforementioned circle) are selected. 
    
    The filtering is based on two major steps:
        
        -First filter: If two peaks from the SNOW algorithm are in the same circle (or two overlapped circle with the same size), only one is selected.This the one which have the biggest value in the Euclidean distance map
        -Second filter: Only the peaks that are inside the largest discs are selected. Instead with every pixel,
        it is done with every region from the labeled region. 
    
    Aftewards, the new filters are passed to normal marker-based watershed segmentation (found in Python package skimage.segmentation.watershed) to perform the new segmention of the pore space. 
    
    
    Inputs parameters:
    ---------
        -snow= results from the SNOW algorithm. distance map, maximum peaks, labelled regions.
        -porosimetry: Map obtained from the porosimetry method.
        -binary image: This is the binary image of the porous structure.
    
    Return parameter
    ---------
    results: An object previously designed by PorespyÂ´s authors. The object has the following attributes:
        
    Attribute
    
    regions: The void space segmented according to the SNOWPOROS algorithm differents units (marked as labels).
    markers: Boolean image/matrix where the pixels with value 1 denote the place where the SNOWPOROS algorithm places the selected markers. 

    
   This function can be called and applied similarly to the SNOW algorithm. Vist the following page for inspiration:
